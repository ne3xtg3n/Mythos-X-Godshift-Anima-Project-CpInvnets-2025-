🎬 Title Card:

MYTHOS X : GODSHIFT — EPISODE 1: “HEAVENFALL”

Narration (DBZ Style):

In a universe older than time, where creation and destruction wage eternal war, two gods awaken from slumber.
Aether — the radiant Architect of Order.
Oblivion — the shadow that unmakes all truth.

Their battle rages across dimensions… until the impact, the Mythquake, tears through Earth itself.

Three humans feel the aftershock.
One of strength.
One of intellect.
One of darkness.

From this moment forward, humanity will never be the same.
The age of the GODSHIFT begins…

🧩 SCENE 1: THE MYTHQUAKE CLASH (00:00–01:20)

Setting: Outer space above Earth — atmosphere bending under golden and violet storms.

Visual: Two gods collide; their fists create a shockwave that ripples through time itself.

(Chris Place Image in this Placeholder Image#1)

Key Dialogue:

AETHER: “Creation demands balance.” OBLIVION: “Then let balance die.” 

Effect: Planet trembles; sky fractures into hexagonal light patterns.

Transition: Fade to the sound of a heartbeat.

⚡ SCENE 2: THE AFTERSHOCK (01:20–03:00)

Setting: Earth — city streets, labs, factories — people freeze as gravity distorts.

Visual: 

Cars hover inches off the ground.

Lights flicker violet.

Wind freezes mid-motion.

(Chris Place Image in this Placeholder Image#2)

Narration (like DBZ announcer):

“When gods clash, mortals tremble. But some… hear the call.”

💥 SCENE 3: THE AWAKENING BELOW (03:00–06:00)

Character Focus: 

JAX REYES — Street boxer, strength of ten men, unaware of his potential.

DR. MICHAEL BANNER — Frail but brilliant, decoding energy patterns in his lab.

KAEL DRAYVEN — Mechanic-turned-engineer, haunted by loss.

Visual Notes:

Gold sparks crawl up Jax’s arms.

Blue glyphs rotate around Banner.

Kael’s shadow flickers with violet flame.

(Chris Place Image in this Placeholder Image#3)

Key Dialogue:

BANNER: “This… this pattern—it’s language. A divine frequency.” 

🔥 SCENE 4: KAEL’S REBELLION (06:00–10:00)

Kael stands amid destruction — violet aura tearing up the asphalt.

His voice deepens as Oblivion Archon speaks through him.

Jax arrives, gold aura flickering.

Their first impact bends light.

(Chris Place Image in this Placeholder Image#4)

DBZ-Style Moment:

Energy collides. The shockwave clears the clouds. Birds vanish. Aether’s energy glows from above.

Key Dialogue:

KAEL: “You protect them? They’re parasites. Let the gods decide.” 

🌠 SCENE 5: THE AETHER UNLEASHED (10:00–17:00)

Jax falls to one knee. Aether’s voice whispers: 

“Creation is not mercy... it’s choice.”

Golden sigils spread across his body.

Debris reverses direction; fires unburn.

AETHER FORM activates — glowing geometric armor.

(Chris Place Image in this Placeholder Image#5)

Key Dialogue:

JAX: “Then my choice is this—live!” 

Shockwave pushes Kael back miles through the city.

Banner watches on monitors, whispering: “Gods reborn... through men.”

🌌 SCENE 6: HEAVENFALL (17:00–22:00)

Both avatars ascend above the city.

Oblivion tears open a black rift; Aether seals it with fractal light.

Dual attacks collide: Aether Burst vs Null Vector Collapse.

White sphere forms; everything stops.

The moon cracks.

(Chris Place Image in this Placeholder Image#6)

Narration (closing):

“When gods fall… humanity rises.”

End Title:

MYTHOS X : GODSHIFT — “HEAVENFALL”

🌑 POST-CREDIT SEQUENCE

Banner watches from a ruined tower.

A fragment of energy drifts into his hand.

Monitors flicker: WELLSPRING_PROTOCOL_01 — ACTIVE.
