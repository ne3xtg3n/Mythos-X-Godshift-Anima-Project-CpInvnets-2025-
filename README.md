​🎬 TITLE CARD
​MYTHOS X : GODSHIFT — EPISODE 1: “HEAVENFALL”
​NARRATOR (DBZ Style - Cp tone, over cosmic nebula visuals):
“In a universe older than time, where creation and destruction wage eternal war, two gods awaken from slumber. Aether — the radiant Architect of Order. Oblivion — the shadow that unmakes all truth. Their battle rages across dimensions… until the impact, the Mythquake, tears through Earth itself. Three humans feel the aftershock. One of strength. One of intellect. One of darkness. From this moment forward, humanity will never be the same. The age of the GODSHIFT begins…”

​🧩 SCENE 1 — THE MYTHQUAKE CLASH (00:00–01:20)
​SETTING: Outer space, high above Earth’s atmosphere. The cosmos bends under golden and violet energy storms.
​VISUAL: Two titanic, ethereal figures, one blazing gold (AETHER SOVEREIGN) and one shadowy violet (OBLIVION ARCHON), collide with unimaginable force. Their fists meet, generating a shockwave that distorts the fabric of space-time around Earth. The planet below trembles violently.

SCENE 2 — THE AFTERSHOCK (01:20–03:00)
​SETTING: Earth – various locations: bustling city streets, high-tech research labs, grimy industrial factories.
​VISUAL: The cosmic shockwave hits Earth. Time seems to stretch and distort. Cars hover inches off the ground, their tires spinning uselessly. Streetlights flicker violently, casting an unnatural violet glow over everything. Wind freezes mid-motion, leaving leaves and dust suspended in the air. People on the streets freeze in place, looking up at the fracturing sky, their faces a mixture of confusion and terror. Inside a lab, equipment sparks wildly; in a factory, machinery grinds to a halt.

SCENE 3 — THE AWAKENING BELOW (03:00–06:00)
​SETTING: Earth – simultaneous close-ups on three distinct individuals.
​VISUAL:
​JAX REYES: Mid-punch in a gritty, sweat-soaked boxing gym. As the shockwave hits, his eyes snap open, and tiny gold sparks begin to crawl up his arms, coiling around his muscles. He drops his sparring partner with an accidental, immense burst of strength.
​DR. MICHAEL BANNER: Hunched over complex, flickering monitors in his dimly lit, cluttered lab. His glasses are askew. As the energy pulses, intricate blue glyphs begin to rotate and shimmer around his head, seemingly decoding the chaotic energy patterns on his screens. He clutches his head, overwhelmed by the sudden influx of information.
​KAEL DRAYVEN: Underneath a broken-down vehicle in a desolate junkyard garage, covered in grease. As the violet energy ripples, his shadow seems to detach and flicker with an ominous violet flame. His eyes briefly glow a deep, unsettling purple. He feels a sudden, profound sense of emptiness, a pull towards unraveling.
